/*
Create a CRUD (API) where you will register, phone numbers in a phone book, 
you need to save the following fields:
First name.
Surnames.
Phones: N telephones can be stored.
Email: N Emails can be saved.
You must use MySQL, ensuring the integrity of every transaction 
(add dump file to the code)

You should only make the Endpoints of a REST API, which will 
be consumed through POSTMAN for its evaluation.

The use of PHP Framework is not allowed.

Nice to Have:
Save the photo of contacts.
Create a call to filter the contacts for each of the fields: Name, Surname, 
any of the captured phones and/or any of the captured emails
Code must be allocated on Github (provide the link) and please 
mount the API in a hosting and personal domain and also share it with us.
